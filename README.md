# Whatsapp-Multiple-Forwards
WhatsApp image forwarding to multiple people using pyautogui.
Since WhatsApp limits a user to forward an image to only 5 contacts at a time, and there is a necessity to forward it to many,
this code can be helpful in solving your problem.
*Imp: A lot improvements can/should  be made!*
Create file named "numbers.txt" which conatins all the contacts to forward an image. 
To use an already opened browser by selenium:
1) Set chrome as an evironment variable path.
2) Run this command in the CLI:``chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\selenum\ChromeProfile"``
3) Open the page required for selenium to act upon.
