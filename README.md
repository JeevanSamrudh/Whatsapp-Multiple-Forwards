# Whatsapp-Multiple-Forwards
WhatsApp image forwarding to multiple people using pyautogui.
Since WhatsApp limits a user to forward an image to only 5 contacts at a time, and there is a necessity to forward it to many,
this code can be helpful in solving your problem.
*Imp: A lot improvements can/should  be made!*
Create file named "numbers.txt" which conatins all the contacts to forward an image. 
To use an already opened browser by selenium:
1) Set chrome as an evironment variable path.
2) In the current-working-directory create a directory named ``ChromeProfile``
3) Click on start.cmd (works on only windows)
4) Open the page required for selenium to act upon.
